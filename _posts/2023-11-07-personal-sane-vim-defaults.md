I have found many "sane" default configs on the net and this is my favorite
personal list. This is how my `.vimrc` file looks like.

```vimrc
syntax enable

set nocompatible
set relativenumber
set hlsearch
set smartcase
set ignorecase
set incsearch
set autoindent
set autoread
set nowrap
set noswapfile
set wildmenu
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
set scrolloff=4
```

I keep it pretty vanilla so this is about everything I have in the file.
