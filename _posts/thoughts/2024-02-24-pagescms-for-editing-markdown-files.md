I just checked out [http://pagescms.org](http://pagescms.org) and this thing is absolutely amazing. Extreemly easy to set up. Kudos to the author. Very similar to Decap. It's a Git-based CMS. A lot of the times I wanted to write something on this site but was too lazy to do all the terminal work. Gonna give it a test run.
