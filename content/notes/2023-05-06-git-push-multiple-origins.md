Sometimes you want to push to multiple origins at once. This is useful if you
have a mirror of your repository on another server. You can do this by adding
multiple push urls to your git config. This is a shorthand for command above.

```sh
git config --global alias.pushall '!sh -c "git remote | xargs -L1 git push --all"'
```
