In the root of your repository create a folder `.github/workflows` and in that
folder create a file a file `cron.yaml`. This file can be named whatever you
wish. But it has to be a `yaml` file.

File below (`.github/workflows/cron.yaml`) describes an action that will trigger
every six hours and it will curl example.com.

However. Be sure that you have enough credits. Free account is not that generous
with the minutes they give you for free. Check more about GitHub Actions usage
on their website https://docs.github.com/en/actions.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/cron.yaml
name: Do a curl every 6 hours
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
jobs:
  cron:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Call some url
        run: curl 'https://example.com'
```
