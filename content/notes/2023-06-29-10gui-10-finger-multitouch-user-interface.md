Message from 10/GUI team (page 10gui.com does not exist anymore):

*Over a quarter-century ago, Xerox introduced the modern graphical user
interface paradigm we today take for granted.*

*That it has endured is a testament to the genius of its design. But the
industry is now at a crossroads: New technologies promise higher-bandwidth
interaction, but have yet to find a truly viable implementation.*

*10/GUI aims to bridge this gap by rethinking the desktop to leverage technology
in an intuitive and powerful way.*
