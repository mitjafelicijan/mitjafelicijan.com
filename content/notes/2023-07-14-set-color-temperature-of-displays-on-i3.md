I have been using Gnome's night shift for a while now and I have been missing
this feature under i3wm. This can be done with
[redshift](https://linux.die.net/man/1/redshift).

- On Debian install with `sudo apt install redshift`
- And then manually set it with `redshift -O 3000`
- Reset the current settings with `redshift -x`
