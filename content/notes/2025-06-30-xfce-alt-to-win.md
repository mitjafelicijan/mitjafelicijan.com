To change the modifier key from Alt to the Win (Super/Meta) key for moving and
resizing windows in Xfce:

1. Open Window Manager Tweaks:
    - Go to Settings → Window Manager Tweaks (or run `xfwm4-tweaks-settings`
      from a terminal).
2. Go to the “Accessibility” Tab:
    - Look for the option "Key used to grab and move windows".
3. Change the Modifier Key:
    - By default, this is set to Alt.
    - Change it to Super (or Meta, depending on your keyboard layout - this is
      the Windows key on most keyboards).
