Set up weechat to connect to #cat-v on oftc. This applies to
[weechat](https://weechat.org/) but should be similar for other irc clients.

```sh
# Install weechat and launch it and execute the following commands.

/server add oftc irc.oftc.net -tls
/set irc.server.oftc.autoconnect on
/set irc.server.oftc.autojoin "#cat-v"
/set irc.server.oftc.nicks "nick1,nick2,nick3"
```
