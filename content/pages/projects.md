- [Simple snapshot manager](#simple-snapshot-manager)

While most of my projects are hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mitjafelicijan), I wanted a centralized location to
store them independently of GitHub and provide different versions in a bit
cleaner way.

## Simple snapshot manager

Simple snapshot utility that uses TAR to compress current directory into a
`.tar` file while ignoring some of the directories.
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/mitjafelicijan/sm).

- Version 0.1 / 2024-10-21 ([sm-v0.1.tar](/snapshots/sm-v0.1.tar))
  - First release.
  - Able to tag and create tar snapshots.
