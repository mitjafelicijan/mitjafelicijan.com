## Introduction

A while ago I bought some
[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) and
[ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) dev boards to play
around with and I finally found a project to try it out.

For my project, I used [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)
but I could easily choose
[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266).  This guide
contains which tools I use and how I prepared my workspace to code for
[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266).

This guide covers:

- flashing SOC
- install proper tooling
- deploying a simple script

> Make sure that you are using **a good USB cable**. I had some problems with
mine and once I replaced it everything started to work.

## Flashing the SOC

Plug your ESP8266 to USB port and check if the device was recognized with
executing `dmesg | grep ch341-uart`.

Then check if the device is available under `/dev/` by running `ls
/dev/ttyUSB*`.

> **Linux users**: if a device is not available be sure you are in `dialout` 
> group. You can check this by executing `groups $USER`. You can add a user to
> `dialout` group with `sudo adduser $USER dialout`.

After these conditions are meet go to the navigate to
[https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/](https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/)
and download `esp8266-20200902-v1.13.bin`.

```sh
mkdir esp8266-test
cd esp8266-test

wget https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20200902-v1.13.bin
```

After obtaining firmware we will need some tooling to flash the firmware to the
board.

```sh
sudo pip3 install esptool
```

You can read more about `esptool` at
[https://github.com/espressif/esptool/](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/).

Before flashing the firmware we need to erase the flash on device. Substitute
`USB0` with the device listed in output of `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`.

```sh
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
```

If flash was successfully erased it is now time to flash the new firmware to it.

```sh
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 esp8266-20200902-v1.13.bin
```

If everything went ok you can try accessing MicroPython REPL with ` screen
/dev/ttyUSB0 115200` or `picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b115200`.

> Sometimes you will need to press `ENTER` in `screen` or `picocom` to access 
> REPL.

When you are in REPL you can test if all is working properly following steps.

```py
> import machine
> machine.freq()
```

This should output a number representing a frequency of the CPU (mine was
`80000000`).

When you are in `screen` or `picocom` these can help you a bit.

| Key      | Command              |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| CTRL+d   | preforms soft reboot |
| CTRL+a x | exits picocom        |
| CTRL+a \ | exits screen         |


## Install better tooling

Now, to make our lives a little bit easier there are couple of additional tools
that will make this whole experience a little more bearable.

There are twq cool ways of uploading local files to SOC flash.

- ampy → [https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy](https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy)
- rshell → [https://github.com/dhylands/rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell)

### ampy

```bash
# installing ampy
sudo pip3 install adafruit-ampy
```

Listed below are some common commands I used.

```bash

# uploads file to flash
ampy --delay 2 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put boot.py

# lists file on flash
ampy --delay 2 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 ls

# outputs contents of file on flash
ampy --delay 2 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 cat boot.py
```

> I added `delay` of 2 seconds because I had problems with executing commands.

### rshell

Even though `ampy` is a cool tool I opted with `rshell` in the end since it's
much more polished and feature rich.

```bash
# installing ampy
sudo pip3 install rshell
```

Now that `rshell` is installed we can connect to the board.

```bash
rshell --buffer-size=30 -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -a
```

This will open a shell inside bash and from here you can execute multiple
commands. You can check what is supported with `help` once you are inside of a
shell.

```bash
m@turing ~/Junk/esp8266-test
$ rshell --buffer-size=30 -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -a

Use Control-D (or the exit command) to exit rshell.
```

> Inside a shell `ls` will display list of files on your machine. To get list 
> of files on flash folder `/pyboard` is remapped inside the shell. To list files

#### Moving files to flash

To avoid copying files all the time I used `rsync` function from the inside of
`rshell`.

```bash
rsync . /pyboard
```

#### Executing scripts

It is a pain to continuously reboot the device to trigger `/pyboard/boot.py` and
there is a better way of testing local scripts on remote device.

Lets assume we have `src/freq.py` file that displays CPU frequency of a remote
device.

```py
# src/freq.py

import machine
print(machine.freq())
```

Now lets upload this and execute it.

```bash
# syncs files to remove device
rsync ./src /pyboard

# goes into REPL
repl

# we import file by importing it without .py extension and this will run the script
> import freq

# CTRL+x will exit REPL
```
