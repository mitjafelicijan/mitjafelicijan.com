A couple of months ago, I got an idea about micro soundtracks. In this concept,
you are the observer, director, and audience in this tiny movies.

What you do is to attempt to imagine what would be happening around you based on
a title of the song and let the song help you fill the void in your story.

I made these songs is Logic Pro X. Every year or so I do this kind of thing and
make a couple of songs similar to this. But this is the first time I am posting
about it.

You can listen to the whole set on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5oXBhSmF3c) or scroll down the page
and there are embedded players for each song.

## A bunch of inter-dimensional people with loud clocks

A group of inter-dimensional people are going up and down the elevator with you
while having loud clocks around their necks. Each clock ticks on a different
frequency. A lot of other sounds are getting drawn into your dimension,
resulting in a strange merging of dimensions.

## Two black holes conversing about the weather

You are a traveler in a spaceship flying very close to two colliding black holes
having a discussion about the weather while tearing each other apart. During all
this your ship is getting pulled into the event horizon of both black holes,
putting a lot of strain on your spaceship.

## A planet where every organism is a plant

You land on a planet where every living organism is a plant and among those
plants some of them are highly intelligent, and you were asked to make first
contact with the native species. Your visit takes place in a giant cave where
you are meeting these plants, and they are talking to you.

## Bio implants having a fit and reprogramming your brain

In a distant future where everybody has bio implants, you have just received
your first one, which happens to be a brain implant. Something goes wrong, and
your implant is starting to misbehave, and you are experiencing brain
malfunctions. You are on the streets at night a couple of hours after your
procedure. You can feel your sanity breaking down.
