Programming can be a challenging and rewarding experience, but sometimes it's 
easy to feel burnt out or disinterested. I have lost the passion for coding 
over the past couple of months and it looked like I will never enjoy the 
coding as much as I did.

I was feeling burnt out with programming. I thought taking a break from it 
and focusing on other activities that I enjoy might be helpful. This way, I 
could come back to programming with a fresh perspective and renewed energy. 
I also thought about learning a new programming language or technology to 
keep things interesting and challenging.

However, what I didn't realize was that learning a new language or technology 
wasn't going to solve the underlying issue. I needed to take a step back and 
re-evaluate why I had lost my passion for programming in the first place. 
This involved taking a deep look into what I was doing that resulted in 
this rut.

Sometimes, it's easy to get caught up in the hype of new technologies or 
languages, and we can feel like we're missing out if we're not constantly 
learning and experimenting. However, it's important to remember that the 
latest and greatest isn't always the best fit for our projects or our 
interests. Instead of constantly chasing the next big thing, it can be helpful 
to focus on what truly interests us and what we're passionate about. This 
can help us stay motivated and engaged with our work, rather than feeling 
like we're just going through the motions.

I expressed that I had lost my passion for coding over the past couple of 
months, and I realized that the reason behind it was my tendency to spread 
myself too thin and not focus on completing interesting projects. In order 
to regain my passion for coding, I need to focus on projects that truly 
interest me and give me a sense of purpose and motivation.

Recently, I have been playing World of Warcraft more frequently and have 
become interested in developing addons for the game.

This quickly resulted in me creating three addons that improve the quality 
of life, and I subsequently developed a more useful add-on that encapsulates 
all the others I made.

I found it interesting that this action sparked a new interest in me. 
Additionally, I discovered the Lua language, which reminded me that coding 
should be fun rather than just a struggle with a language. It should be 
pure, unadulterated fun.

I wasn't fighting the syntax, nor was I focused on finding the most optimal 
solution. I simply created things without the pressure of making them the 
best they could possibly be.

This made me realize that I actually adore simple languages that get out of 
the way and let you express what you want to do. It forced me to rethink a 
lot about what I use and what I actually enjoy.

I have decided to stick to the basics. For a scripting language, I will use 
Lua. For networking, I will use Golang. And for any special needs, I will 
rely on C. I do not require Rust, Nim, or Zig. This selection is more than 
sufficient for my needs. I have to stay true to this simplicity. There is 
something to the Occam's Razor.

I've been struggling with a lack of creativity lately, but now I'm experiencing 
a real change. I realized I needed to take a step back and stop actively trying 
to address the issue. I needed to stop worrying and overthinking it. I simply 
needed some time. Looking back, I don't think I've taken any significant time 
off in the last 10 years.

Suddenly, I find myself with the energy and passion to complete multiple 
small projects. It doesn't feel like a chore at all. Who knew I needed WoW 
to kickstart everything. Inspiration really does come from the strangest 
places.
