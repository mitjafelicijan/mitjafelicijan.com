Programming can be a challenging and rewarding experience, but sometimes it's
easy to feel burnt out or disinterested. I have lost the passion for coding over
the past couple of months and it looked like I will never enjoy the coding as
much as I did.

I was feeling burnt out with programming. I thought taking a break from it and
focusing on other activities that I enjoy might be helpful. This way, I could
come back to programming with a fresh perspective and renewed energy.  I also
thought about learning a new programming language or technology to keep things
interesting and challenging.

However, what I didn't realize was that learning a new language or technology
wasn't going to solve the underlying issue. I needed to take a step back and
re-evaluate why I had lost my passion for programming in the first place.  This
involved taking a deep look into what I was doing that resulted in this rut.

Sometimes, it's easy to get caught up in the hype of new technologies or
languages, and we can feel like we're missing out if we're not constantly
learning and experimenting. However, it's important to remember that the latest
and greatest isn't always the best fit for our projects or our
interests. Instead of constantly chasing the next big thing, it can be helpful
to focus on what truly interests us and what we're passionate about. This can
help us stay motivated and engaged with our work, rather than feeling like we're
just going through the motions.

I expressed that I had lost my passion for coding over the past couple of
months, and I realized that the reason behind it was my tendency to spread
myself too thin and not focus on completing interesting projects. In order to
regain my passion for coding, I need to focus on projects that truly interest me
and give me a sense of purpose and motivation.

Recently, I have been playing World of Warcraft more frequently and have become
interested in developing addons for the game.

This quickly resulted in me creating three addons that improve the quality of
life, and I subsequently developed a more useful add-on that encapsulates all
the others I made.

I found it interesting that this action sparked a new interest in me.
Additionally, I discovered the Lua language, which reminded me that coding
should be fun rather than just a struggle with a language. It should be pure,
unadulterated fun.

I wasn't fighting the syntax, nor was I focused on finding the most optimal
solution. I simply created things without the pressure of making them the best
they could possibly be.

This made me realize that I actually adore simple languages that get out of the
way and let you express what you want to do. It forced me to rethink a lot about
what I use and what I actually enjoy.

I have decided to stick to the basics. For a scripting language, I will use
Lua. For networking, I will use Golang. And for any special needs, I will rely
on C. I do not require Rust, Nim, or Zig. This selection is more than sufficient
for my needs. I have to stay true to this simplicity. There is something to the
Occam's Razor.

I've been struggling with a lack of creativity lately, but now I'm experiencing
a real change. I realized I needed to take a step back and stop actively trying
to address the issue. I needed to stop worrying and overthinking it. I simply
needed some time. Looking back, I don't think I've taken any significant time
off in the last 10 years.

Suddenly, I find myself with the energy and passion to complete multiple small
projects. It doesn't feel like a chore at all. Who knew I needed WoW to
kickstart everything. Inspiration really does come from the strangest places.
