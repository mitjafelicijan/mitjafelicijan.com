Recently I have been using my Thinkpad x220 more and there are some constraints
I have faced with it. CPU is not as powerful as on my main machine and I really
want to listen to some music while using the machine. Browsers really are bloat.

Check out this site https://streamurl.link/ and copy the stream url and then do
`mpv streamlink`.
