## Brief introduction to K-mer

A "k-mer" refers to all the possible substrings of length \\(k\\) contained in a
string, which is commonly used in computational biology and bioinformatics. In
the context of DNA, RNA, or protein sequences, a k-mer is a sequence of \\(k\\)
nucleotides (for DNA and RNA) or amino acids (for proteins).

The concept of k-mers is fundamental in various bioinformatics applications,
including genome assembly, sequence alignment, and identification of repeat
sequences. By analyzing the frequency and distribution of k-mers within a
sequence or set of sequences, researchers can infer structural characteristics,
identify genetic variants, and compare genomic or proteomic compositions between
different organisms or conditions.

For example, in genome assembly, k-mers are used to reconstruct the sequence of
a genome from a collection of short sequencing reads. By finding overlaps
between the k-mers derived from these reads, assembly algorithms can piece
together contiguous sequences (contigs), which represent longer sections of the
genome.

The choice of \\(k\\) (the length of the k-mer) is crucial and depends on the
specific application. A larger \\(k\\) provides more specificity (useful for
distinguishing between closely related sequences), while a smaller \\(k\\)
offers greater sensitivity (useful for detecting repeats or low-complexity
regions). However, the computational resources required increase with \\(k\\),
as there are \\(4^k\\) possible k-mers for nucleotide sequences (due to the four
types of nucleotides: A, T, C, G) and \\(20^k\\) for amino acid sequences (due
to the twenty standard amino acids).

## K-mer counting

K-mer counting is a fundamental process in bioinformatics used for analyzing the
frequency of k-mers (subsequences of length \\(k\\)) in DNA, RNA, or protein
sequences. Efficient k-mer counting is crucial for various applications such as
genome assembly, metagenomics, and sequence comparison. The implementation
typically involves parsing a sequence into all possible k-mers and then counting
the occurrences of each unique k-mer. Here's a general approach to implementing
k-mer counting:

### Reading the Sequences

The first step involves reading the genetic or protein sequences from files,
which are often in formats like FASTA or FASTQ. These files contain one or
multiple sequences that will be processed to extract k-mers.

### Generating K-mers

For each sequence, generate all possible subsequences of length \\(k\\). This is
done by sliding a window of size \\(k\\) across the sequence, one nucleotide (or
amino acid) at a time, and extracting the subsequence within this window.

### Counting K-mers

The extracted k-mers are then counted. This can be achieved using various data
structures:

- **Hash Tables (Dictionaries)**: They offer an efficient way to keep track of
  k-mer counts, with k-mers as keys and their frequencies as values. This
  approach is straightforward but can become memory-intensive with large
  datasets or large values of \\(k\\).
- **Suffix Trees or Arrays**: These data structures are more space-efficient for
  k-mer counting, especially for large datasets. They allow for efficient
  retrieval of k-mer occurrences but are more complex to implement.
- **Bloom Filters and Count-Min Sketch**: For very large datasets, probabilistic
  data structures like Bloom filters or Count-Min Sketch can estimate k-mer
  counts using significantly less memory, at the cost of a controlled error
  rate.

### Handling Memory and Performance Issues

K-mer counting can be memory-intensive, especially for large values of \\(k\\) or
large datasets. Optimizations include:

- **Compressing K-mers**: Representing k-mers using a binary format rather than
  strings can save memory.
- **Parallel Processing**: Distributing the k-mer counting task across multiple
  processors or machines can significantly speed up the process.
- **Minimizing I/O Operations**: Efficiently reading and processing sequences
  from files in chunks reduces I/O overhead.

### Post-processing

After counting, the k-mer frequencies can be used directly for analyses or can
undergo further processing, such as filtering rare k-mers, which are often
errors, or normalizing counts for comparative analysis.

### Implementation Example

Here's a simple Python example using a dictionary for k-mer counting:

```python
def count_kmers(sequence, k):
    kmer_counts = {}
    for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1):
        kmer = sequence[i:i+k]
        if kmer in kmer_counts:
            kmer_counts[kmer] += 1
        else:
            kmer_counts[kmer] = 1
    return kmer_counts

# Example usage
sequence = "ATGCGATGATCTGATG"
k = 3
kmer_counts = count_kmers(sequence, k)
print(kmer_counts)
```

This code snippet counts the occurrences of each 3-mer in a given sequence.

For real-world applications, especially those involving large datasets, consider
using specialized bioinformatics tools like Jellyfish, KMC, or khmer, which are
optimized for efficiency and scalability.

Now that we have the basics out of the way we can start implementing basic k-mer
counter in C.
